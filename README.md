VS265 Final Project — Sparse Coding Dream Machines

In 1983, Crick and Mitchison proposed a theory of REM sleep, where the purpose of dreams is hypothesized to be to “unlearn,” or to remove unnecessary connections between neurons in a neural network. One such mathematical and computational formalism of this is the wake-sleep algorithm [1], which aims to recreate this biological idea through an dual phase unsupervised learning algorithm. In the sleep phase, we aim to strengthen generative connections between increasingly abstract layers. That is, from the layer of most abstraction, we aim to generate weights that can generate the representation of the next most abstract layer. The output of this “sleep phase” can be viewed as a “dream.” We are interested in visualizing these “dreams” to see how a wake sleep model may create a representation of natural images. To make this more biologically relevant, instead of directly training a wake sleep model on natural images, we will train it on a sparse coding representation of natural images. This additional abstraction and sparsity may give us very fascinating insights into how we learn, and how we dream. To sum up, we trained a sparse coding representation of natural images, using that representation to train a wake sleep model, and decoding and visualizing the generative sparse codes of the sleep phase.
